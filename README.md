# Linux Backup Script

This project is a Bash script to automate backups on a Linux system.  
It allows you to back up specific directories, filter files by extension, and save compressed backups.  
The script supports dry-run mode, logging, configuration file, and optional encryption.

You can modify the list in `backup.conf`.
